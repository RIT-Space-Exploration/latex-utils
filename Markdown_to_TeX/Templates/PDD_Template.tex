\author{
  % List the authors of the design document. The Champion should go first.
  % The \$~\$ markers tell \LaTeX{} to treat the text inside to be treated as a math expression. This way you can use operators like \textcaret{} to place characters as superscripts.
  % Some \LaTeX{} templates handle the author block in different ways. For example, the \href{http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/jai}{Journal of Astronomical Instrumentation} requires the authors' addresses and emails to be included as well.
  % The \textbackslash{}thanks command puts the contents inside those brackets in a footnote at the bottom of the first page. Technically speaking, \textbackslash{}thanks is just a specially formatted footnote.
  % IEEE also has a ``long form'' author block for many authors. Check here for more information:
  % \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/156523/multiple-authors-with-common-affiliations-in-ieeetran-conference-template}
  % Read here for a more advanced options to modifying footnotes in the author block:  \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/826/symbols-instead-of-numbers-as-footnote-markers}
  %   Here, we use the IEEE long-form author block.

  %%   If there are many authors, consider using symbolic, numeric (aka arabic),  alphabet footnotes or a combination thereof.
  %% the recommended order for symbolic footnotes is
  %%   (1) asterisk        *   *
  %%   (2) dagger          †   \dagger
  %%   (3) double dagger   ‡   \ddagger
  %%   (4) section symbol  §   \S
  %%   et cetera. For higher counts, use 2x symbols (1)-(4) (i.e. (5) two asterisks **). Keep cycling through (1)-(4) using 3x, 4x, and so on.
  %%   Note that these symbol codes work in math mode and text mode.
  %%   There are ways to make LaTeX do this for you, but it is more advanced and not entirely necessary, especially for short author lists. Not worth the hassle, in my opinion.

ABSTRACT_TAG

      % The abstract is a brief summary of the design document. Typically it includes the purpose of the design document, key goals or objectives, and justifications.
      % Be sure not to confuse the abstract with the introduction.
      % It is easiest to write the abstract after the rest of the paper has been written.
      % That way you can choose key information from the sections that you've already completed and string them together in the abstract.
      % Consider the abstract to be your elevator pitch to anyone reading this design document.
      % What are they reading?
      % What is the goal?
      % Why is it worth my time?
      % The abstract is what will show up in Google results and other search engines, and what people will read when they are deciding what is worth their time and brain power.
